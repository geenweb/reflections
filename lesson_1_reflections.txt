If I keep working versions of my program, I can diff a newer non-work version to see what has changed.

Keeping a history of revisions of a programmer could make me more efficient should I make changes, but at some point later decide I want to chang some of the code back.

Auto commits ensure that a commit are made, although they may be too small, or incomplete logically. Manual commits ensure making commits that make sense, but you need the discipline to do them.

Git commits multiple files (a repository) since it designed to handle program files in which a programatic change may very well affect multiple files. Google docs on the other hand is not designed as a programming version control system. It has individual unrelated files in mind.

git log lists all of the repository commits that have been made. git diff can then be used to compare various commits tosee the actual line changes.

Since I can use versioning to find my errors, and I can revert back, I can try ideas without worry.
